# Project Updates

## UI/Demo Implementation (June 1, 2025)

The following updates have been made to implement a comprehensive demo system for the Colorful Canvas AI Art Studio:

### 1. Demo Applications

- **Command Line Demo**: Added an interactive command-line demo (`demo/demo.py`) that allows users to:
  - Browse and select sample images
  - Choose from different anamorphic effects
  - Generate AI-powered illusions
  - Save results to the output directory

- **Web Demo**: Created a modern, interactive web interface (`demo/web/`) with:
  - Drag-and-drop image upload
  - Sample image gallery
  - Effect selection with previews
  - Real-time processing visualization
  - Detailed viewing instructions
  - Download capability

### 2. Project Structure Standardization

- Created a standardized project structure document (`docs/PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md`)
- Reorganized directories to follow the standard structure:
  - `src/` for source code
  - `data/` with subdirectories for raw, processed, interim, and sample data
  - `models/` for trained models
  - `output/` for results
  - `demo/` for demonstration applications
  - `docs/` for documentation

### 3. User Experience Improvements

- Added a simple launcher script (`run_demo.sh`) to easily run different demos
- Updated the README with clear instructions for using the demos
- Added viewing instructions for each anamorphic effect

### 4. Documentation

- Added a `PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md` file documenting the standard project structure
- Updated the README with enhanced usage instructions
- Added a README in the demo directory

These updates ensure that the project is well-structured, thoroughly documented, and provides multiple user-friendly ways to interact with the Colorful Canvas AI Art Studio.
