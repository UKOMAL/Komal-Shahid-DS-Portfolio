This repository contains data science projects completed during my Master's program at Bellevue University's Applied Data Science Capstone (DSC680). Each project demonstrates advanced skills in machine learning, data analysis, and software development with real-world applications.

## 🚀 Featured Projects

### [Project 1: Depression Detection System](./projects/project1-depression-detection/)

An AI-powered system for detecting indicators of depression from written text using NLP and deep learning techniques.

**Key Features:**
- Natural language processing of clinical text data
- Multi-model neural network architecture for sentiment analysis
- Privacy-preserving data preprocessing for sensitive mental health information
- Interactive interface for mental health professionals
- Comprehensive ethical considerations and limitations analysis

**Technologies:** TensorFlow, BERT, Flask, Python, NLP

### [Project 2: Federated Healthcare AI](./projects/project2-federated-healthcare-ai/)

A privacy-preserving federated learning framework enabling healthcare institutions to collaboratively train AI models without sharing sensitive patient data.

**Key Features:**
- Federated learning architecture with differential privacy
- Multi-modal data support (imaging, tabular, time series)
- Secure aggregation of model updates
- Performance evaluation across simulated institutions
- Privacy-utility tradeoff analysis

**Technologies:** PyTorch, Federated Learning, Differential Privacy, Python

## 🌐 Interactive Demo
