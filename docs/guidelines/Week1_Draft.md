# DSC680 - Week 1: Milestone 1 - Project Proposal

## Overview
Week 1 focuses on developing your project proposal for the first of three data science projects you'll complete in this course. This initial milestone establishes the foundation for your project and sets the direction for your analysis.

## Project Description
As stated in the course description: "You have been a data scientist since the day you began this program. You may not have recognized it, but it's been there the whole time. In this course, you're not only going to recognize it, but show us what you can do."

You will be performing 3 analyses and presentations of data that is useful or interesting to you. Each project is domain agnostic, data agnostic, and method agnostic - meaning you can choose any domain, use any existing data, and analyze it using whatever methods you deem appropriate.

## Milestone 1 Requirements
Submit a proposal with the following sections as a PDF:

### 1. Topic
- Describe and name your project in 1-2 sentences max
- Choose something that interests you and demonstrates your data science skills

### 2. Business Problem
- Describe the business problem your project is trying to solve
- Outline the specific research questions you will explore
- Be clear and concise about what you aim to accomplish

### 3. Datasets
- Identify where you are getting your data
- Describe the data you will use to solve the problem
- Include information about data size, format, and key variables
- Ensure the data is accessible and sufficient for your analysis

### 4. Methods
- Outline what analysis methods you will use to complete this project
- Note: This is just a proposal; your project can adapt as you work on it
- Consider including both exploratory and modeling techniques

### 5. Ethical Considerations
- Identify potential ethical concerns related to this topic or analyzing the data
- Consider privacy, bias, fairness, and potential impacts of your analysis

### 6. Challenges/Issues
- Describe potential issues and challenges you think you might face
- Consider data limitations, technical challenges, and scope management

### 7. References
- List sources you will use to validate your results and support your project topic
- Use APA format for all references

## Submission Guidelines
- Format: Submit as a PDF document
- Due Date: Sunday evening of Week 1
- Submit through the course portal

## Next Steps
After completing Milestone 1, you will:
- Week 2: Work on your project
- Week 3/Milestone 2: Submit a draft of your White Paper (3-5 pages)
- Week 4/Milestone 3: Deliver a recorded presentation with your final white paper

## Tips for Success
- Choose a topic that genuinely interests you
- Ensure your data is accessible before committing to a project
- Consider the feasibility of completing the analysis within the timeframe
- Think about how you can tell a compelling, jargon-free story with your data
- Focus on providing useful insights for those in your chosen domain
