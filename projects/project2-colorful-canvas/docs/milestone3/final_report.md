## Implementation Details

### AI Components

#### Generative Module

The generative module leverages diffusion models to transform text prompts and structural guidance into high-quality images:

```python
class ArtGenerator:
    def __init__(self, model_path="stabilityai/stable-diffusion-xl-base-1.0", device=None):
        self.device = device or ("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")
        self.pipe = StableDiffusionXLPipeline.from_pretrained(
            model_path,
            torch_dtype=torch.float16 if self.device == "cuda" else torch.float32,
            use_safetensors=True,
            variant="fp16" if self.device == "cuda" else None
        ).to(self.device)
        
        # Optimization: Use DPMSolver++ for faster inference
        self.pipe.scheduler = DPMSolverMultistepScheduler.from_config(
            self.pipe.scheduler.config, 
            algorithm_type="dpmsolver++", 
            solver_order=2
        )
        
        self.lora_models = {}
        self.current_loras = {}
```

Style adaptation is achieved through Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), which allows efficient fine-tuning of the base model for various artistic styles:

```python
def apply_lora(self, lora_name, scale=None):
    if lora_name not in self.lora_models:
        raise ValueError(f"Unknown LoRA adapter: {lora_name}")
    
    lora_info = self.lora_models[lora_name]
    actual_scale = scale if scale is not None else lora_info["scale"]
    
    # Load and apply the LoRA weights
    self.pipe.load_lora_weights(lora_info["path"])
    self.current_loras[lora_name] = actual_scale
    return True
```

The module supports style blending, allowing users to combine multiple artistic styles with configurable weights:

```python
def blend_styles(self, prompt, style_weights, negative_prompt="", 
                width=1024, height=1024, num_inference_steps=30):
    # Reset current LoRAs
    for lora_name in self.current_loras:
        self.pipe.unload_lora_weights()
    self.current_loras = {}
    
    # Apply each LoRA with its weight
    for style_name, weight in style_weights.items():
        self.apply_lora(style_name, weight)
    
    # Generate the image
    return self.generate_image(
        prompt=prompt,
        negative_prompt=negative_prompt,
        width=width,
        height=height,
        num_inference_steps=num_inference_steps
    )
```

#### Structural Control

The ControlNet integration provides structural guidance for the generation process, allowing users to influence the composition through sketches or other conditioning inputs:

```python
class StructuralGuidance:
    def __init__(self, base_model_path="stabilityai/stable-diffusion-xl-base-1.0", device=None):
        self.device = device or ("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")
        self.controlnets = {}
        self.current_controlnet = None
        self.base_model_path = base_model_path
        self.pipe = None
```

The module supports multiple control types, including edge detection and depth maps:

```python
def prepare_canny_image(self, image_path, low_threshold=100, high_threshold=200):
    # Load the image
    if isinstance(image_path, str):
        image = cv2.imread(image_path)
    else:
        # Convert PIL image to OpenCV format if needed
        image = np.array(image_path)
        image = cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_RGB2BGR)
    
    # Apply Canny edge detection
    edges = cv2.Canny(image, low_threshold, high_threshold)
    
    # Convert back to RGB (ControlNet expects RGB)
    edges = cv2.cvtColor(edges, cv2.COLOR_GRAY2RGB)
    
    # Convert to PIL image
    return Image.fromarray(edges)
```

The final generation process combines the text prompt with the structural guidance:

```python
def generate_from_structure(self, prompt, control_image, negative_prompt="",
                           width=1024, height=1024, guidance_scale=7.5,
                           controlnet_conditioning_scale=1.0, seed=None):
    # Set the random seed if provided
    if seed is not None:
        generator = torch.Generator(device=self.device).manual_seed(seed)
    else:
        generator = None
    
    # Generate the image with control
    result = self.pipe(
        prompt=prompt,
        negative_prompt=negative_prompt,
        image=control_image,
        width=width,
        height=height,
        guidance_scale=guidance_scale,
        controlnet_conditioning_scale=controlnet_conditioning_scale,
        generator=generator,
        num_inference_steps=30
    )
    
    return result.images[0]
```

#### Denoising Module

The denoising module enhances image clarity while preserving artistic details using a custom FFDNet architecture:

```python
class FFDNetDenoiser(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(FFDNetDenoiser, self).__init__()
        
        # First layer, input: image and noise level map
        self.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(4, 64, kernel_size=3, padding=1)
        self.relu1 = nn.ReLU(inplace=True)
        
        # Middle layers
        self.layers = nn.ModuleList()
        for _ in range(15):
            self.layers.append(nn.Conv2d(64, 64, kernel_size=3, padding=1))
            self.layers.append(nn.ReLU(inplace=True))
            
        # Final layer
        self.conv_final = nn.Conv2d(64, 3, kernel_size=3, padding=1)
```

The denoising process incorporates perceptual loss to preserve artistic details:

```python
class PerceptualLoss(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, feature_layers=[3, 8, 15, 22]):
        super(PerceptualLoss, self).__init__()
        from torchvision.models import vgg19, VGG19_Weights
        
        vgg = vgg19(weights=VGG19_Weights.DEFAULT).features.eval()
        self.model = vgg
        self.feature_layers = feature_layers
        
        # Freeze parameters
        for param in self.parameters():
            param.requires_grad = False
```

The module supports adaptive noise level estimation for optimal denoising:

```python
def train(self, clean_images, noisy_images, epochs=100, batch_size=16, 
          learning_rate=0.0001, save_path=None):
    # ...
    
    # Process all images in batches
    for i in range(0, len(clean_images), batch_size):
        batch_clean = []
        batch_noisy = []
        batch_noise_levels = []
        
        # Prepare batch
        for j in range(i, min(i + batch_size, len(clean_images))):
            # Load and preprocess images
            clean = self.transform(clean_images[j]).to(self.device)
            noisy = self.transform(noisy_images[j]).to(self.device)
            
            # Estimate noise level (difference between clean and noisy)
            noise_level = ((noisy - clean) ** 2).mean().sqrt().item()
            noise_level = min(max(noise_level, 0), 1)  # Clamp to [0, 1]
            
            batch_clean.append(clean)
            batch_noisy.append(noisy)
            batch_noise_levels.append(noise_level)
```

### Backend API

The FastAPI-based backend provides a robust interface for the frontend application:

```python
app = FastAPI(
    title="Colorful Canvas API",
    description="API for the Colorful Canvas AI Art Studio",
    version="0.1.0",
)

# Add CORS middleware
app.add_middleware(
    CORSMiddleware,
    allow_origins=["*"],  # For development - restrict in production
    allow_credentials=True,
    allow_methods=["*"],
    allow_headers=["*"],
)
```

The API includes endpoints for generation, style blending, structural control, and denoising:

```python
@app.post("/generate", response_model=GenerationResponse)
async def generate_image(request: GenerationRequest):
    """Generate an image based on text prompt and optional style."""
    try:
        # Initialize or get the art generator
        generator = get_art_generator()
        
        # Apply style if specified
        if request.style:
            generator.apply_lora(request.style.value, request.style_weight)
        
        # Generate the image
        image = generator.generate_image(
            prompt=request.prompt,
            negative_prompt=request.negative_prompt,
            width=request.width,
            height=request.height,
            num_inference_steps=request.num_inference_steps,
            guidance_scale=request.guidance_scale,
            seed=request.seed
        )
        
        # Save the image
        image_id = str(uuid.uuid4())
        output_path = os.path.join("output", "generated", f"{image_id}.png")
        full_path = os.path.join(project_root, output_path)
        image.save(full_path)
        
        # Convert image to base64 for preview
        buffered = BytesIO()
        image.save(buffered, format="PNG")
        img_str = base64.b64encode(buffered.getvalue()).decode()
        
        # Return the response
        return GenerationResponse(
            image_path=f"/output/generated/{image_id}.png",
            image_data=f"data:image/png;base64,{img_str}",
            seed=request.seed if request.seed is not None else 0
        )
    
    except Exception as e:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail=str(e))
```

### Frontend User Interface

The React-based frontend provides an intuitive, customizable interface:

```jsx
function App() {
  // State for generation
  const [prompt, setPrompt] = useState('');
  const [negativePrompt, setNegativePrompt] = useState('');
  const [width, setWidth] = useState(512);
  const [height, setHeight] = useState(512);
  const [inferenceSteps, setInferenceSteps] = useState(30);
  const [guidanceScale, setGuidanceScale] = useState(7.5);
  const [seed, setSeed] = useState('');
  const [selectedStyle, setSelectedStyle] = useState('');
  const [styleWeight, setStyleWeight] = useState(0.7);
  
  // State for UI
  const [isGenerating, setIsGenerating] = useState(false);
  const [result, setResult] = useState(null);
  const [theme, setTheme] = useState(THEMES[0]);
  const [isAdvancedMode, setIsAdvancedMode] = useState(false);
  const [error, setError] = useState('');
```

The interface includes an interactive canvas for sketch-based control:

```jsx
// Canvas drawing functions
const startDrawing = (e) => {
  const canvas = canvasRef.current;
  const ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');
  
  const rect = canvas.getBoundingClientRect();
  const x = e.clientX - rect.left;
  const y = e.clientY - rect.top;
  
  ctx.beginPath();
  ctx.moveTo(x, y);
  setIsDrawing(true);
};

const draw = (e) => {
  if (!isDrawing) return;
  
  const canvas = canvasRef.current;
  const ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');
  
  const rect = canvas.getBoundingClientRect();
  const x = e.clientX - rect.left;
  const y = e.clientY - rect.top;
  
  ctx.strokeStyle = canvasMode === 'draw' ? 'black' : 'white';
  ctx.lineTo(x, y);
  ctx.stroke();
};
```
