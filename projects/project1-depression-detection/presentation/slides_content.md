## Slide 2: Problem Statement
### The Challenge

- Depression affects 264+ million people globally
- Average 10-year delay between onset and treatment
- Subtle symptoms often go unrecognized
- Stigma prevents many from seeking help

## Slide 3: Project Goals
### Project Objectives

[IMAGE: Target/bullseye with goals]

1. Develop accurate NLP model for depression detection
2. Balance sensitivity and specificity
3. Create accessible, integration-ready interface
4. Ensure privacy and ethical data handling
5. Validate against clinical screening tools

## Slide 4: Data Sources
### Data Acquisition & Preparation

[IMAGE: Data pipeline diagram]

- **Reddit dataset**: 30,000+ anonymized posts from depression-related subreddits
- **DAIC-WOZ**: Transcribed clinical interviews
- **Synthetic data**: Augmenting underrepresented linguistic patterns

*All data anonymized, cleaned, and balanced*

## Slide 5: Methodology
### Technical Approach

- **Core**: DistilBERT transformer architecture
- **Features**: Semantic content + linguistic depression markers
- **Training**: Transfer learning with fine-tuning
- **Explainability**: SHAP values for interpretation

## Slide 6: Model Performance
### Results

- 87% accuracy
- 89% sensitivity (recall)
- 85% specificity
- F1 score: 0.88

*Consistent performance across demographics and writing styles*

## Slide 7: Ethical Considerations
### Ethics & Responsible Implementation

- Screening tool only, not diagnostic replacement
- Confidence intervals and factor explanations
- Differential privacy for data protection
- Human-in-the-loop review process
- Regular bias audits

## Slide 8: Interactive Demo
