## Slide 2: The Privacy Challenge
### Data Silos vs. Privacy Concerns

[IMAGE: Split image - data silos / privacy & security]

- Healthcare data is valuable but extremely sensitive
- Traditional approaches:
  - Limited local datasets = poor generalization
  - Centralized data = privacy & regulatory concerns
- HIPAA regulations restrict data sharing
- Institutional competitive concerns

## Slide 3: Federated Learning
### The Core Concept

*The model travels to the data, not data to the model*

1. Same model architecture across institutions
2. Local training on private data
3. Only model updates shared, never raw data
4. Central aggregation of updates
5. Improved model redistributed to all

## Slide 4: Project Objectives

**5 healthcare institutions, 3,000-5,000 X-rays each**

- 92% accuracy (vs. 84-89% local models)
- No patient data exchange
- 72-hour training time
- Consistent cross-site performance
- Îµ = 3 differential privacy guarantee

## Slide 9: Regulatory Compliance
### Built-in by Design

[IMAGE: Regulations diagram]

- HIPAA compliant data handling
- Comprehensive audit trails
- Data minimization principles
- Simplified patient consent
- GDPR compatible
- Streamlined IRB approval process

## Slide 10: Performance Results
### Federated vs. Centralized

[IMAGE: Comparative performance graphs]

- Chest X-rays: 97% of centralized performance
- Mortality prediction: 99% of centralized
- Medication dosing: 95% of centralized
- Rare disease ID: 7% better than centralized

*Privacy with minimal performance trade-off*
