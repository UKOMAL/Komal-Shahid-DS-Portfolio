## Implementation Details

### System Architecture

The system follows a modular design with five core components:

1. **Client Subsystem**: Deployed at healthcare institutions, handling local data preprocessing, model training, and secure communication
   ```python
   class FederatedClient:
       def __init__(self, client_id, data_loader, privacy_mechanism='differential', epsilon=1.0):
           self.client_id = client_id
           self.data_loader = data_loader
           self.privacy_engine = PrivacyEngine(privacy_mechanism, epsilon)
           # ...
   ```

2. **Server Subsystem**: Coordinates the federated learning process without accessing raw data
   ```python
   class FederatedServer:
       def __init__(self, aggregation_strategy='fedavg', min_clients=3):
           self.global_model = None
           self.aggregation_strategy = self._get_strategy(aggregation_strategy)
           # ...
   ```

3. **Privacy Layer**: Provides comprehensive privacy protections
   ```python
   class PrivacyEngine:
       def __init__(self, mechanism='differential', epsilon=1.0, delta=1e-5):
           self.mechanism = mechanism
           self.epsilon = epsilon
           self.noise_multiplier = self._calculate_noise_multiplier(epsilon, delta)
           # ...
   ```

4. **Communication Layer**: Optimizes data transfer between participants
   ```python
   class CommunicationManager:
       def __init__(self, compression_rate=0.1, quantization_bits=32):
           self.compression_rate = compression_rate
           self.quantization_bits = quantization_bits
           # ...
   ```

5. **Model Repository**: Manages versioning and deployment of models
   ```python
   class ModelRepository:
       def __init__(self, storage_path, versioning=True):
           self.storage_path = Path(storage_path)
           self.versioning = versioning
