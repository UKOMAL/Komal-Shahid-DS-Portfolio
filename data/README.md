# Shared Data Resources

This directory contains shared data resources used across multiple portfolio projects.

## Contents

- `healthcare/` - Shared healthcare datasets used by multiple projects
- Image samples for examples and demonstrations

## Usage

Individual projects should reference these shared resources as needed but should keep project-specific data within their own project directories.

## Note

Large datasets are not committed to GitHub. See the root `.gitignore` file for details on excluded files.
