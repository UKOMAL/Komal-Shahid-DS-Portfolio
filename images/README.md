# Profile Photo Instructions

To complete your GitHub Pages portfolio, please add your profile photo to this directory with the name `profile-image.jpg`.

## Steps:

1. Find a professional photo of yourself
2. Resize it to approximately 400x400 pixels
3. Save it as `profile-image.jpg` 
4. Place it in this directory (assets/images/)

When you push this to GitHub, make sure the photo is referenced correctly in your index.md file with:

```
![Profile Image](assets/images/profile-image.jpg)
```

This will ensure your profile photo appears at the top of your GitHub Pages portfolio.
