SLIDE 2: THE PRIVACY CHALLENGE

Data Silos vs. Privacy Concerns:

• Healthcare data is valuable but extremely sensitive
• Traditional approaches:
  - Limited local datasets = poor generalization
  - Centralized data = privacy & regulatory concerns
• HIPAA regulations restrict data sharing
• Institutional competitive concerns

-----------------------------------------------------
SLIDE 3: FEDERATED LEARNING

The Core Concept:

"The model travels to the data, not data to the model"

1. Same model architecture across institutions
2. Local training on private data
3. Only model updates shared, never raw data
4. Central aggregation of updates
5. Improved model redistributed to all

-----------------------------------------------------
SLIDE 4: PROJECT OBJECTIVES

Our Goals:

• Healthcare-optimized federated learning framework
• Advanced privacy-preserving techniques
• Support for heterogeneous data distributions
• Cross-institutional scalability
• Performance matching centralized approaches
• Clinical explainability
• Regulatory compliance

-----------------------------------------------------
SLIDE 5: SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE

Technical Design:

• Client-side training modules
• Secure aggregation server
• End-to-end encrypted communication
• Differential privacy mechanisms
• Homomorphic encryption capability
• Model compression for efficiency
• Administrative monitoring console

-----------------------------------------------------
SLIDE 6: IMPLEMENTATION CHALLENGES

Technical Solutions:

• Non-IID data: Adaptive aggregation algorithm
• Communication: 80% reduction via gradient compression
• Security: Multi-party computation protocols
• System diversity: Hardware-adaptive framework
• Reliability: Asynchronous aggregation method

-----------------------------------------------------
SLIDE 7: PRIVACY PROTECTIONS

Multi-layered Approach:

• Differential Privacy
• Secure Multi-party Computation
• Homomorphic Encryption
• Federated Analytics
• Formal Privacy Guarantees

Comprehensive protection with mathematical bounds

-----------------------------------------------------
SLIDE 8: CASE STUDY

Collaborative Chest X-ray Analysis:

5 healthcare institutions, 3,000-5,000 X-rays each

• 92% accuracy (vs. 84-89% local models)
• No patient data exchange
• 72-hour training time
• Consistent cross-site performance
• ε = 3 differential privacy guarantee

-----------------------------------------------------
SLIDE 9: REGULATORY COMPLIANCE

Built-in by Design:

• HIPAA compliant data handling
• Comprehensive audit trails
• Data minimization principles
• Simplified patient consent
• GDPR compatible
• Streamlined IRB approval process

-----------------------------------------------------
SLIDE 10: PERFORMANCE RESULTS

Federated vs. Centralized:

• Chest X-rays: 97% of centralized performance
• Mortality prediction: 99% of centralized
• Medication dosing: 95% of centralized
• Rare disease ID: 7% better than centralized

Privacy with minimal performance trade-off
