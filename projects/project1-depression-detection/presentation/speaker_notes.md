**Speaker Notes:**
Good afternoon everyone. Today, I'm presenting my work on a Depression Detection System that uses Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning to identify potential signs of depression in written text. This project sits at the intersection of artificial intelligence and mental health, with the goal of creating an accessible screening tool that could help identify those who might need professional support.

## Slide 2: Problem Statement
**Title: The Challenge**

*[IMAGE: Insert a graph showing rising depression statistics over time]*

**Speaker Notes:**
Depression affects over 264 million people globally according to the WHO, yet many cases go undiagnosed. The average delay between onset of symptoms and treatment is approximately 10 years. This delay occurs for multiple reasons: stigma around mental health, lack of accessible screening tools, and the often subtle progression of symptoms that individuals might not recognize in themselves. Our challenge was to develop a system that could serve as an initial, non-invasive screening tool to help identify potential depression indicators from natural language.

## Slide 3: Project Goals
**Title: Project Objectives**

*[IMAGE: Insert a target/bullseye with multiple rings representing the goals]*

**Speaker Notes:**
The primary objectives of this project were to:
1. Develop an accurate NLP model to detect linguistic patterns associated with depression
2. Create a system that balances sensitivity and specificity - we need to identify potential cases without excessive false alarms
3. Design an accessible interface that could be integrated into various platforms like telehealth systems, patient portals, or even social media
4. Ensure privacy and ethical handling of all data, maintaining HIPAA compliance
5. Validate the system against established clinical screening tools

## Slide 4: Data Sources
**Title: Data Acquisition & Preparation**

*[IMAGE: Insert a diagram showing the data pipeline from collection to preprocessing]*

**Speaker Notes:**
For this project, we utilized multiple data sources:
- A carefully curated dataset of Reddit posts from depression-related and control subreddits, with over 30,000 anonymized text samples
- The DAIC-WOZ dataset containing transcribed clinical interviews
- A synthetic dataset created to augment specific linguistic patterns underrepresented in the main datasets

All data was anonymized, cleaned, and balanced to ensure no demographic biases. The preprocessing pipeline included tokenization, removing personally identifiable information, and handling class imbalance through techniques like SMOTE.

## Slide 5: Methodology
**Title: Technical Approach**

*[IMAGE: Insert a flowchart of the model architecture showing data flow from input to prediction]*

**Speaker Notes:**
Our approach combined multiple NLP techniques:
1. We implemented a DistilBERT-based transformer model as our core architecture
2. Feature extraction focused on both semantic content and linguistic markers known to correlate with depression, such as:
   - Increased use of first-person singular pronouns
   - Absolute terms like "always" and "never"
   - Negative emotional content
   - Linguistic indicators of social isolation
3. The model was fine-tuned using transfer learning from pre-trained language models
4. We incorporated explainability techniques like SHAP values to make the model's decisions interpretable for healthcare professionals

## Slide 6: Model Performance
**Title: Results & Performance Metrics**

**Speaker Notes:**
Our final model achieved:
- 87% accuracy on the test dataset
- 89% sensitivity (recall), which was prioritized to minimize missed cases
- 85% specificity, balancing false positives
- F1 score of 0.88

The model performed consistently across different demographics and writing styles. Importantly, we found that combining multiple linguistic features significantly outperformed models that relied solely on semantic content or emotional word detection.

## Slide 7: Ethical Considerations
**Title: Ethics & Responsible Implementation**

*[IMAGE: Insert a balance scale with "privacy/ethics" on one side and "effectiveness" on the other]*

**Speaker Notes:**
Throughout this project, ethical considerations were paramount:
- The system is designed as a screening tool only, not a diagnostic replacement
- All predictions include confidence intervals and explanations of the contributing factors
- We implemented differential privacy techniques to protect user data
- A human-in-the-loop approach ensures healthcare professionals review flagged content
- Regular bias audits ensure the system performs consistently across different demographic groups
- Clear communication to users about how their data is being used and the limitations of the system

## Slide 8: Interactive Demo
**Title: System Demonstration**

*[IMAGE: Insert screenshots of the user interface showing the input form and results display]*

**Speaker Notes:**
Here you can see the web interface we've developed. The system accepts text input - which could be journal entries, social media posts, or responses to specific prompts. The analysis runs in real-time, providing an assessment of depression indicators along with the confidence level and specific linguistic patterns identified. Healthcare providers can use this dashboard to review multiple patients and track changes over time. Let me walk you through a quick demonstration...

## Slide 9: Future Directions
**Title: Looking Forward**

*[IMAGE: Insert a roadmap visualization showing future development phases]*

**Speaker Notes:**
While the current system shows promising results, we have several directions for enhancement:
1. Expanding to multiple languages beyond English
2. Developing specialized models for different age groups, particularly adolescents
3. Creating mobile applications for continuous passive monitoring with user consent
4. Integrating with EHR systems for streamlined clinical workflows
5. Incorporating multimodal inputs such as speech patterns and vocal biomarkers
6. Longitudinal studies to validate the system's effectiveness as an early screening tool

## Slide 10: Conclusion
**Title: Thank You**

*[IMAGE: Insert a collage of the project's key components and team members]*

**Speaker Notes:**
To conclude, the Depression Detection System demonstrates how NLP can be leveraged as a screening tool for mental health conditions. While technology cannot replace human connection and professional care, it can serve as an accessible first step in identifying those who might benefit from further assessment. By combining advanced machine learning with careful ethical implementation, we hope this work contributes to earlier intervention and better outcomes for individuals experiencing depression.

I welcome any questions you might have about the technical implementation, ethical considerations, or potential applications of this system.
